## Server
The [server mod](https://github.com/ToneAPI/ToneAPI_servermod) allows server hosters to link their game servers to Tone.

Once installed, this mod will send data to the API every time a player dies.

## Dev
[The documentation](https://toneapi.github.io/ToneAPI_backend/) will help you if you want to access the API to create web clients, discord bots or any other kind of application.
